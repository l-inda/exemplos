(Recall the point about estimating life expectancy using a linear model based on a limited amount of data.) The illusion of accuracy to one percentage is a fallacy. The above number, for example, is based on looking at a large number of job descriptions – perhaps licking the tip of your finger and putting it up to feel the wind – and using subjective grounds to decide which tasks are likely to be automated. It is understandable that people don\'t take the trouble to read a 79 page report that includes statements such as "the task model assumes for tractability an aggregate, constant-returns to-scale, Cobb-Douglas production function." However, if you don\'t, then you should remain somewhat sceptical about the conclusions too. The real value in this kind of analysis is that it suggests which kinds of jobs are more likely to be at risk, not in the actual numbers such as 47%.
