People used to science-fictional depictions of robots will usually think of humanoid machines walking with an awkward gait and speaking in a metallic monotone. Most real-world robots currently in use look very different as they are designed according to the application. Most applications would not benefit from the robot having human shape, just like we don't have humanoid robots to do our dishwashing but machines in which we place the dishes to be washed by jets of water.<br><br>It may not be obvious at first sight, but any kind of vehicles that have at least some level of autonomy and include sensors and actuators are also counted as robotics. On the other hand, only software based solutions such as customer service chatbot, even if they are sometimes called `software robots´ aren´t counted as (real) robotics."},children:[{type:"text",value:"\n  "}]},{type:"text",value:"\n"}]},{type:"text",value:"\n"},{type:"element",tagName:"div",properties:{},children:[{type:"text",value:"\n"},{type:"element",tagName:"quiz",properties:{quizid:"5aec3eb9e82e4700047ad407"},children:[{type:"text",value:"\n"}]},{type:"text",value:"\n"}]},{type:"text",value:"\n"},{type:"element",tagName:"div",properties:{},children:[{type:"text",value:"\n"},{type:"element",tagName:"quiz",properties:{quizid:"5aec479606ee0000047c5967"},children:[{type:"text",value:"\n"}]},{type:"text",value:"\n"}]}],data:{quirksMode:!1}},excerpt:"Machine learning  can be said to be a subfield of AI, which itself is a subfield of  computer science .
